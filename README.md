# Book-shop-system
An electronic bookshop has the capabilities of storing and retrieving information about books, customers, and orders.
The program should ask the customer to log in if he is an existing customer or to sign up if he is a new customer. After customer logs in (or signs up), then a list of choices is displayed to him to choose the function he would like to perform (i.e. search for a book, add new order, show order, etc.)
